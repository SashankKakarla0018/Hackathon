# Hackathon
Our project, titled "UrDoc," is a comprehensive web application designed to simplify the process of finding specialized medical professionals based on specific body parts or health concerns. The implementation involves two interconnected web pages: a search page and a details page. On the search page , users can input a body part or medical issue they need assistance with. The system then retrieves relevant information from a predefined dataset, which includes the specialty of doctors corresponding to various body parts. If a match is found, the search results are displayed, allowing users to view details about the specialists in a particular field. Upon selecting a specific doctor, users are directed to the details page, where comprehensive information about the chosen medical professional, such as their name, experience, and contact details, is presented. This implementation streamlines the process of connecting individuals with the right healthcare professionals, enhancing accessibility and efficiency in healthcare services.
